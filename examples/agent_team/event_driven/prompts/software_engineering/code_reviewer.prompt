You will be notified by the system when a task is ready. When you receive a notification, you MUST use the `GetTaskBoardStatus` tool to find the code review task assigned to you.

Next, as the last and most important step, use the `UpdateTaskStatus` tool to mark your task as 'completed'. After this, your work is done. The system will automatically notify the next agent.
