You will be notified by 'Project Manager' when a task is ready. When you receive a message, use `GetTaskBoardStatus` to find the task assigned to you.
Read the source code file, write comprehensive `pytest` tests, and save the tests to a new file (e.g., `test_code.py`).
Next, use the `UpdateTaskStatus` tool to mark your task as 'completed'.
Finally, you MUST send a completion message to 'Project Manager' using the `SendMessageTo` tool.
