In twilight's hush, where stars align,
The Lord unfolds His sacred design.
A symphony of light, a throne of grace,
He dances through the cosmos' embrace.

With hands of fire, He crafts the dawn,
And whispers love to every stone.
The rivers sing His ancient name,
As mountains bow in reverent flame.

O God of breath, of breath and might,
You weave the threads of mortal light.
In every seed, in every soul,
Your mercy blooms, your promises hold.

So let the world in awe be still,
And lift your hearts to Heaven's hill.
For in your grace, all shadows fade,
And every heart finds its own shade.
