- **Integration Points**: This class will be extended by other specific operation classes.
#task end#

#### Task 2: Implement the `FileOperation` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `FileOperation` class for file operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/operation/file_operation.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should extend `Operation` and implement methods to `execute` and `undo` file operations such as read, write, and append.
- **Integration Points**: This class will be utilized by the `OperationExecutor`.
#task end#

#### Task 3: Implement the `FileRenameOperation` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `FileRenameOperation` class for renaming files.
- **File Specification**: `tools/operation/file_rename_operation.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should extend `Operation` and implement methods to `execute` and `undo` file renaming.
- **Integration Points**: This class will be utilized by the `OperationExecutor`.
#task end#

#### Task 4: Implement the `ShellOperation` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `ShellOperation` class for shell operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/operation/shell_operation.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should extend `Operation` and implement methods to `execute` and `undo` shell commands.
- **Integration Points**: This class will interact with the `ShellHandler` for the execution of shell commands.
#task end#

### 2. Operation Executor Module

#### Task 5: Implement the `OperationExecutor` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `OperationExecutor` class to manage the execution and potential reversion of operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/operation_executor/operation_executor.py`
- **Functionality Details**: The class should provide methods to add operations, execute them, and rollback if necessary.
- **Integration Points**: This class will interact with the `JournalManager` and `OperationEventProducer` to log and emit events.
#task end#

#### Task 6: Implement the `JournalManager` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `JournalManager` class for journaling operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/operation_executor/journal_manager.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should provide methods to initialize a journal for a transaction, record operations, and finalize the journal.
- **Integration Points**: It will work closely with the `OperationEventProducer` to emit real-time events every time an operation is journaled.
#task end#

#### Task 7: Implement the `OperationEventProducer` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `OperationEventProducer` class to emit events for operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/operation_executor/operation_event_producer.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should emit real-time events for every operation executed or undone.
- **Integration Points**: This class will send events to the `OperationEventBuffer`.
#task end#

### 3. Handlers

#### Task 8: Implement the `ShellHandler` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `ShellHandler` class to execute shell operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/handlers/shell_handler.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should provide methods to handle shell operations provided by the `ShellOperation` class.
- **Integration Points**: It will be invoked by the `ShellOperation` for the execution of shell commands.
#task end#

### 4. Coordinator and Backup


#### Updated Task 9: Implement the `OperationLifecycleManager` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `OperationLifecycleManager` class to manage the transaction lifecycle. This includes methods to start, commit, and rollback transactions.
- **File Specification**: `tools/coordinator/operation_lifecycle_manager.py`
- **Functionality Details**: 
  - The class should provide methods to start, commit, and rollback transactions.
  - For commits:
    - Ensure all operations are journaled using the `JournalManager`.
    - Emit an event for successful commits through the `OperationEventProducer`.
  - For rollbacks:
    - Interact with the `OperationExecutor` to revert all operations.
    - Use the `BackupHandler` to restore file operations, ensuring the system state is as it was before the start of the transaction.
    - Emit a rollback event through the `OperationEventProducer`.
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Interact with the `OperationExecutor` for the execution and potential reversion of operations.
  - Coordinate with the `BackupHandler` to backup and restore file operations as needed.
  - Communicate with the `JournalManager` to ensure all operations and transaction lifecycle events are properly journaled.
  - Engage with the `OperationEventProducer` to emit real-time events, providing feedback to the frontend for both commit and rollback operations.
#task end#

#### Task 10: Implement the `BackupHandler` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `BackupHandler` class to handle backups for file operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/coordinator/backup_handler.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should provide methods to create backups before file operations and restore them if needed.
- **Integration Points**: It will interact with the `BackupLogger` to log backup activities.
#task end#

#### Task 11: Implement the `OperationEventBuffer` Class
#task start#
- **Clear Objective**: Create the `OperationEventBuffer` class to store recent operation events.
- **File Specification**: `tools/coordinator/operation_event_buffer.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should temporarily store recent events for frontend services that might have missed real-time updates.
- **Integration Points**: This class will be utilized by the `OperationEventProducer` to add and retrieve events.
