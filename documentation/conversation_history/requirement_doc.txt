create repositories base classes in python to facilicate search and store
in cassandra db. I have one AI agent. The AI agent is communicating with large 
language model through LLMIntegration class. 
I need to store all the sent and return message in the context of workflow. The 
starting point of workflow is requirement step. 

Background Setup: 
We have a AI coding agent under development. The AI coding agent provides tools to 
large language model like ChatGPT. It's like ChatGPT is the brain. There is a development workflow setup in the AI coding agent. Each step in the workflow 
will invoke LLM like ChatGPT by sending prompt, and parse the result. Based on the result sent back from ChatGPT, the agent will invoke different functionalities.

Feature Description:
In this feature,we already have workflow setup, we also have individual step in the workflow. Now we want to store the conversation between the Coding Agent for each step in the workflow in mongodb. The conversation is living in the context 
of a workflow. Invidiual message or chat or code changes are all living in the context of individual step in the workflow.
