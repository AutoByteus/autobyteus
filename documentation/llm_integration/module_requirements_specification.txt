### LLM Integration Module Requirements Specification

#### 1. Module Description:
The LLM Integration Module provides a comprehensive interface for integrating with various Language Learning Models (LLM) providers. It emphasizes on a consistent message processing mechanism across different LLM implementations, with a particular focus on OpenAI's models.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
- **OpenAI Library**: This external library is essential for enabling interactions with OpenAI's API, which is a primary LLM provider supported by this module.

#### 3. Symbols & Usage:
- **[⇌ OpenAI]**: Denotes functionalities or interactions that directly involve the OpenAI Library or OpenAI's LLM implementations.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:

- **Integration Foundation**:
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Provide an abstract class (`BaseLLMIntegration`) that serves as a common interface for various LLM integrations, ensuring consistent message processing.
   - Introduce a foundational abstract class (`BaseOpenAIApi`) to offer consistent functionalities for OpenAI API implementations.
   
- **OpenAI-Specific Implementations**:
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Implement a concrete class (`OpenAIChatApi`) for processing message interactions using the OpenAI Chat API.
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Provide a mechanism (`OpenAIApiFactory`) to instantiate specific OpenAI API classes based on defined types and model names.
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Design a class (`OpenAIGPTIntegration`) that integrates OpenAI GPT models with external programs.

- **Message Management**:
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Define data structures (`openai_message_types`) to represent and manage messages in OpenAI communication.
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Offer classes (`SystemMessage`, `UserMessage`, and `AssistantMessage`) that represent different roles a message can have in the OpenAI communication process.
   - Introduce a utility (`MessageList`) to manage lists of messages, with methods to add and retrieve messages.

- **Integration Registry**:
   - Develop a centralized mechanism (`LLMIntegrationRegistry`) to store, manage, and retrieve various LLM integrations.

4.2. **Technical Specifications**:

- **Enumerations & Types**:
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Define an enumeration (`OpenAIMessageRole`) to represent possible roles a message can have in OpenAI communication.
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Enumerate different OpenAI models (`OpenAIModel`) that the integration supports.
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Enumerate the different API types (`ApiType`) supported by the integration.

- **Dependencies & Interactions**:
   - [⇌ OpenAI] Ensure the module can utilize the `autobyteus.config` to obtain necessary API keys and configurations for LLM integration operations.
   - Recognize and manage dependencies, with specific components like `BaseOpenAIApi` and `OpenAIChatApi` using configurations from `autobyteus.config`.
