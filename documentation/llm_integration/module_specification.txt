### Revised Repository Base Structure Module Specification:

#### 1. Module Description:
The Repository Base Structure module provides a base repository class designed as an interface for interacting with databases. This class emphasizes modularity and extensibility, facilitating basic CRUD operations and robust error-handling capabilities. Other modules within the application can extend this base class to create specific repositories tailored to their needs, adhering to the repository pattern.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
None. (This module doesn't depend on other modules developed within the application.)

#### 3. How To Use This Module:
- Initialize the base repository class with database connection parameters.
- Extend the base repository class in other modules to create specific repositories.
- Utilize the provided methods for CRUD operations in the derived repositories.
- Implement error-handling mechanisms in derived repositories to respond to exceptions and rollbacks.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:

- **CRUD Operations**:
   - Create records in the database.
   - Retrieve records from the database.
   - Update existing records in the database.
   - Delete records from the database.

- **Error Handling**:
   - Rollback any database changes if an error occurs during an operation.
   - Log errors for subsequent investigation.

#### Module Boundaries:
The Repository Base Structure module offers a base repository class for basic CRUD operations and error handling. It does not manage complex database transactions beyond CRUD or handle database connection pooling. Derived repositories, created by extending the base class in other modules, should adhere to the repository pattern and can be adapted across different contexts and systems.
