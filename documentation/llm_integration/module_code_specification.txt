### BaseLLMIntegration Module Code Specification

#### 1. Module Architecture Design:

##### 1.1. High-Level Design
The `BaseLLMIntegration` module is designed to provide a standardized interface for all Language Model (LLM) integrations. The abstract base class ensures that any derived classes implement the necessary methods to process input messages and return LLM responses.

##### 1.2. New Components Specifications

###### 1.2.1. Fully Defined

- **BaseLLMIntegration (New)**
    - **Purpose**: Serves as a common interface for various LLM integrations, ensuring consistent message processing across different implementations.
    - **Attributes**: None.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `process_input_messages(input_messages: list)`: An abstract method that processes a list of input messages and returns the LLM's responses.
    - **Interactions**: None in this file, but derived classes in other parts of the module will interact with this base class by implementing the `process_input_messages` method.

##### 1.3. Interactions Overview
- Derived classes from the overarching module will implement the `process_input_messages` method to provide specific integrations with the LLM.
  
##### 1.4. External Dependencies
- None.

#### 2. UML Diagram

- **UML Legend**:
  - Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this module.
