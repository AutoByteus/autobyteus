### Module Code Specification Template:

#### 1. Module Architecture Design:

##### 1.1. High-Level Design
- Brief overview of the primary module architecture.
- Design patterns, principles, or structures that will be applied.

##### 1.2. New Components Specifications

###### 1.2.1. Fully Defined
For each component:
  - **Name (New) [extends/relates OtherComponentName]** (if applicable)
    - **Purpose**: Clear description of the component's role and functionality within the module.
    - **Attributes**:
      - `attribute_name`: Short description of the attribute and its significance.
      ... Continue for all attributes.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
      - `method_name()`: Describe the method's purpose, expected input, and output.
      ... Continue for all methods.
    - **Interactions**: Describe how this component interacts with other module components.

... Continue for all fully defined new components.

###### 1.2.2. Part-Of Components (Pending File Provision)
For each component:
  - **Name (Part-Of) [extends/relates OtherComponentName]** (if applicable)
    - **Status Note**: _"This component is part of the module, but its detailed specifications will be supplemented upon provision of the relevant file."_
    - **Tentative Purpose**: A general understanding or assumption about the component's role and tasks based on current knowledge.

... Continue for placeholders.

##### 1.3. Used-By Dependencies (Unchanged Components)

For each component:
  - **Name (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: Clear description of the component's role and functionality within the module.
    - **Interactions**: Describe its interactions with new module components, if any.

... Continue for all dependencies.

##### 1.4. Interactions Overview
- A broader perspective on how new module components interact with each other and with existing components.
- Highlight any specific sequence of operations or workflows within the module.

##### 1.5. External Dependencies
- List any third-party libraries, services, or tools that the module will use.
- Specific versions or configurations to be aware of.

#### 2. UML Diagram

- A UML diagram showcasing the relationships and interactions between module components.
- **UML Legend**:
  - Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this module.
  - Components marked with `(Part-Of)` are identified but not fully defined within the module.
  - Components marked with `(Used-By)` are pre-existing and are treated as dependencies within the module context.
