### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
The feature orchestrates an automated coding workflow, modularly structured, where each individual step, derived from a `BaseStep`, represents a distinct phase in the workflow. One of the pivotal aspects of the design is that every step employs its own uniquely configured prompt, which is dispatched to a large language model (LLM) for processing. The workflow allows for serialization to JSON, and specific steps can be executed as needed. The design is enhanced with support for multi-layered steps and sub-steps.

1.2. **New Components**:
- **AutomatedCodingWorkflow (New)**: Manages the automated coding workflow. It is in charge of initializing steps, running specific steps, and serializing the workflow to JSON.
- **WORKFLOW_CONFIG (New)**: Offers configuration specifics for the entire workflow.
- **BaseStep (New)**: Serves as a foundational class for workflow steps. Every distinct step derives from this class and has its own prompt configuration for communication with the LLM.
- **WorkflowStatus (New)**: An enumeration potentially representing different states of the workflow.
- **StepsTemplateConfig (New)**: Configuration parameters for individual steps.
- **RequirementStep (New)**: Processes requirements using its own tailored prompt template.
- **ArchitectureDesignStep (New)**: Handles the architectural design phase with its unique prompt.
- **ImplementationStep (New)**: Oversees the coding implementation phase with its distinct prompt.
- **TestGenerationStep (New)**: Dedicated to generating tests for Python code, equipped with a detailed prompt.

1.3. **Existing Components/Dependencies**:
- **LLMIntegrationRegistry (Existing)**: From the `llm_integrations` package, it manages integrations pertinent to LLM.
- **WorkspaceSetting (Existing)**: Originating from the `workspaces` package, it holds workspace-specific settings.
- **PromptTemplate (Existing)**: From the `prompt` package, it's a template structure for constructing prompts.
- **PromptTemplateVariable (Existing)**: Also from the `prompt` package, it defines variables to be embedded in prompt templates.

1.4. **Interactions**: 
- The `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` initializes steps using the `WORKFLOW_CONFIG`.
- Every step, like `RequirementStep` or `ArchitectureDesignStep`, constructs a unique prompt using `PromptTemplate` and `PromptTemplateVariable`.
- The workflow status might be tracked and set using the `WorkflowStatus`.
- Steps may need to interact with the `LLMIntegrationRegistry` for integration management during execution.
- During initialization, the `WorkspaceSetting` is passed to the `AutomatedCodingWorkflow`.

1.5. **External Dependencies**: 
No third-party libraries, services, or tools have been identified from the provided code segments.
