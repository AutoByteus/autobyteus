Module Code Design Documentation
Purpose: This document provides a comprehensive design overview of the AutomatedCodingWorkflow module from a code perspective. The module is designed to offer a well-defined API for other modules and features, ensuring seamless integration and interaction within the broader system. By detailing the internal components, their interactions, and external dependencies, we aim to provide a clear understanding of how this module functions code-wise and interfaces with other system parts.

#### 1. Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
The `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` class represents a fully automated coding workflow, comprising multiple steps. Each step is an instance of a class derived from `BaseStep`. These steps can further contain sub-steps, leading to a multi-level workflow structure. The steps are initialized based on a configuration, and the entire workflow can be represented as a JSON.

1.2. **Component Descriptions**:
- **AutomatedCodingWorkflow**: The main class representing and managing the automated coding workflow. It holds information about workspace settings, steps, workflow name, configuration, and integration registry.
- **WorkspaceSetting**: Represents the settings associated with the workspace.
- **Steps (Derived from BaseStep)**: Represents the different stages in the workflow. They can be executed individually, and they may also have sub-steps.
- **LLMIntegrationRegistry**: Used for managing integrations within the workflow.

1.3. **Interactions**: 
Users can initialize the `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` with a specific `WorkspaceSetting`. After initialization, users can convert the entire workflow to a JSON representation using the `to_json` method. Additionally, specific steps within the workflow can be executed using the `execute_step` method, provided they supply a valid step ID.

1.4. **External Dependencies**: 
The workflow relies on several modules for its functioning. They include modules for managing integrations, defining base classes for steps, specifying workflow status and configuration, and workspace settings.

#### 2. UML Diagram:
Below is the UML representation of the architecture:

@startuml

package "autobyteus.workflow.config" {
    class WORKFLOW_CONFIG
}

package "External Dependencies" {
    class LLMIntegrationRegistry
    class WorkspaceSetting
}

package "autobyteus.workflow_types.types" {
    class BaseStep
    class WorkflowStatus
    class StepsTemplateConfig
}

package "src.automated_coding_workflow" {
    class AutomatedCodingWorkflow {
        +steps: Dict[str, BaseStep]
        +name: str
        +config: dict
        +_initialize_steps(steps_config: Dict[str, StepsTemplateConfig])
        +to_json(): str
        +execute_step(step_id: str): Optional[str]
        +start_workflow()
    }
}

AutomatedCodingWorkflow ..> WorkspaceSetting: Uses

### Module Design Documentation

**Purpose**: This document provides a comprehensive design overview of the `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` module. The module is designed to furnish a well-defined API for other modules and features, enabling seamless integration and interaction within the larger system. By detailing the internal components, their interactions, and external dependencies, we aim to offer a clear understanding of how this module operates and interfaces with other system parts.

These steps can further contain sub-steps, leading to a multi-level workflow structure. The steps are initialized based on a configuration, and the entire workflow can be represented as a JSON.

1.2. **Component Descriptions**:
- **AutomatedCodingWorkflow**: The primary class representing and managing the automated coding workflow. It contains information about the steps, workflow name, and configuration.
- **Steps (Derived from BaseStep)**: Represents the different stages in the workflow. They can be executed individually, and they may also contain sub-steps.
