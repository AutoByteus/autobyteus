### Automated Coding Workflow System

#### 1. Feature Description:
The Automated Coding Workflow System offers a modular and structured way to manage and execute a multi-step automated coding workflow. The primary users are Software Developers or Team Leads, aiming to streamline the software development process that typically includes tasks like gathering requirements, designing solutions, coding, and testing.

#### 2. Feature Dependencies:
- **LLM System**: The Automated Coding Workflow System integrates with an LLM system to manage external dependencies.

#### 3. Requirements:

3.1. **Functional Requirements**:

- **Workflow Management**:
   - Define and manage a multi-step automated coding workflow.
   - Each step in the workflow can potentially have sub-steps.
   - Integrate with an LLM system to manage external dependencies.
   - Initialize steps of the workflow from a given configuration.
   - Convert the workflow instance to a JSON representation.
   - Start the entire workflow process.
   - Execute specific steps within the workflow using their ID.
   
- **Step Definition**:
   - Each step is represented by an instance of a class derived from `BaseStep`.
   - Construct a unique ID for each step instance.
   - Construct a dynamic prompt for each step.
   - Process the response from the LLM API for each step.
   - Define the execution logic for each step.
   
- **Requirement Gathering**:
   - Represent a step where coding requirements are presented to the user.
   - Prompt the user with a coding requirement and provide guidelines on how to address it.
   - Construct a prompt for this step using a template.
   - Process the response from the LLM API for this step.
   
- **Architecture Design Stage**:
   - Represent the design stage in the coding workflow.
   - Use a template for constructing the design stage's prompt.
