## Plan Of Change

### Title: 
- Integration of Prompt Versioning Mechanism into Automated Coding Workflow System

### Feature Requirement Being Updated:

**Title**: 
- Automated Coding Workflow System

**Abbreviation**:
- ACWS

**Version**: 
- v1.0

**Original Requirement Summary**:
- The Automated Coding Workflow System offers a modular way to manage and execute a multi-step automated coding workflow. It integrates with the LLM system for optimized software development processes.

### Caused By Feature:

**Title**: 
- Prompt Versioning Mechanism for Optimal Communication with Large Language Models

**Abbreviation**:
- PVMOCWLLM

**Version**: 
- v1.0

**Functionality Provided**:
- The mechanism introduces versioning for prompts, dynamic prompt initialization, entity-specific default prompts, version management, comparative analysis, and efficient database interaction.

### Integration/Update Details:

**Workflow Management**:
- Original: Each step in the workflow communicates with LLMs using static prompts.
- Update: Each step in the workflow now dynamically retrieves the effective prompt from the database (Reference: PVMOCWLLM) for optimized communication with LLMs.

**Step Definition**:
- Original: The system uses predefined templates to construct prompts for various workflow steps.
- Update: Each primary and sub-step now has a distinct default prompt, initializing the database for steps without specific prompts (Reference: PVMOCWLLM).

**Requirement Gathering**:
- Original: Coding requirements are communicated to the user using static prompts.
- Update: The system now uses the versioning mechanism to ensure the most effective prompt is used during the requirement gathering phase (Reference: PVMOCWLLM).

**Architecture Design Stage**:
- Original: The design stage's prompt is constructed using a static template.
- Update: The design stage's prompt now utilizes the versioning mechanism to adaptively select the most effective prompt (Reference: PVMOCWLLM).
