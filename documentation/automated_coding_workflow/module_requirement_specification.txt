### Automated Coding Workflow Module Requirements Specification

#### 1. Module Description:
This module facilitates the definition, management, and execution of a multi-step automated coding workflow. It encompasses functionalities to initialize workflow steps from configurations, convert workflow instances to JSON representations, and execute specific steps or the entire workflow.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
- **LLM Integration Module**: This module utilizes the "LLM Integration Module" to interface with large language models like ChatGPT and execute coding instructions.

#### 3. Symbols & Usage:
- **[⇌ LLM Integration Module]**: Denotes functionalities or interactions that are directly tied to the LLM Integration Module.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:
