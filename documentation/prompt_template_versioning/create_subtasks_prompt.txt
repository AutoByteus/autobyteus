Thank you. Now let's move on to creating subtasks based on code design documentation. These subtasks should follow the structure provided in the `[Template]` section.

### Approach 
1. Understand the previous already implemented dependent tasks if given in the [ExistingDependentTasks] section, as they might provide existing components.
2. Think and reason the neccessary subtasks in order to have a complete running feature.
Here subtask does not need to be detailed. And think about their dependencies.
3. Answer the following questions and give why:
   Any new libraries to install? Any new folders or files to create? If yes, think about good naming for these folders and files. Follow python best practice to naming files and folders. Use the current 'ProjectFolderStructure' section as a reference. 
4. Based on the thinking and reasoning until so far, now formalize the creation of subtasks.
   Start with foundational tasks like installing relevant libraries, setting up directories, or creating essential files. After the setup, list all other subtasks in order of execution, considering their dependencies.

Thank you. Now let's move on to creating subtasks based on code design documentation. These subtasks should follow the structure provided in the `[Template]` section.

### Approach 
1. **Think and Reason about Necessary Subtasks**:
    - Outline neccessary subtasks to achieve a complete feature. Remember, details can be minimal initially; focus on understanding the sequence and dependencies.
2. **Answer Preliminary Questions and give why**:
    - Any new libraries to install? 
    - Any new folders or files to create? If yes, Follow good python naming practices for these folders and files. Use the current 'ProjectFolderStructure' section as a guide.
3. **Formalize the Creation of Subtasks based on Step 1 and Step 2**:
    -  Begin with initial task. It installs relevant libraries, setting up the required directories, and creating all essential files for all the other subtasks.
    - List all other subtasks in the order of their dependencies.

[Template]
#### Task [Number]: [Task Name]
#task start#
- **Objective**: [State the goal clearly.]
- **File Specification**: [Indicate the file path for the code.]
- **Functionality Details**: [Explain the code's behavior and purpose.]
- **Integration Points**: [Outline interactions with other code parts and dependencies.]
#task end#

[Example Task]
#### Task 8: Implement the `ShellHandler` Class
#task start#
- **Objective**: Create the `ShellHandler` class to manage shell operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/handlers/shell_handler.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should provide methods to interface with the `ShellOperation` class for shell tasks.
- **Integration Points**: It will be utilized by the `ShellOperation` class to execute shell commands.
#task end#

[ExistingDependentTasks]
#### Task 1: Preliminary Setup
#task start#

- **Objective**: Install necessary libraries and set up the project directory structure.
- **File Specification**: `requirements.txt`, `autobyteus/db/repositories`, `autobyteus/db/models`, `autobyteus/db/utils`
- **Functionality Details**: 
    - Add `SQLAlchemy` and `Alembic` to the `requirements.txt` file.
    - Create a `db` folder under `autobyteus`.
    - Within `db`, create a `repositories` folder to house repository-related classes.
    - Within `db`, create a `models` folder for model-related classes.
    - Within `db`, create a `utils` folder for utility functions or classes.
    - Create the files `base_model.py` in `autobyteus/db/models`, `base_repository.py` in `autobyteus/db/repositories`, and `database_session_manager.py` in `autobyteus/db/utils` for future tasks.
- **Integration Points**: None.

#task end#

#### Task 2: Implement BaseModel
#task start#

- **Objective**: Create the foundational `BaseModel` class.
- **File Specification**: `autobyteus/db/models/base_model.py`
- **Functionality Details**: 
    - Implement the `BaseModel` with common attributes like `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
    - Utilize SQLAlchemy for ORM functionalities.
- **Integration Points**: It will be inherited by other model classes in the future.

#task end#

#### Task 3: Implement DatabaseSessionManager
#task start#

- **Objective**: Create the `DatabaseSessionManager` class to manage database sessions.
- **File Specification**: `autobyteus/db/utils/database_session_manager.py`
- **Functionality Details**: 
    - Implement the context manager methods `__enter__` and `__exit__` for session management.
    - Ensure proper error handling and resource cleanup.
- **Integration Points**: Will be utilized by the `BaseRepository` for CRUD operations.

#task end#

#### Task 4: Implement BaseRepository
#task start#

- **Objective**: Implement the generic `BaseRepository` class.
- **File Specification**: `autobyteus/db/repositories/base_repository.py`
- **Functionality Details**: 
    - Provide CRUD operations (create, get, get_all, update) with the help of SQLAlchemy.
    - Use the `DatabaseSessionManager` for session management.
- **Integration Points**: Will be utilized by the AI coding agent and potentially other repositories in the future.

#task end#

#### Task 5: Alembic Configuration and Initial Migration
#task start#

- **Objective**: Set up Alembic for database migrations.
- **File Specification**: Root directory (for Alembic configurations and migrations)
- **Functionality Details**: 
    - Initialize Alembic configurations.
    - Create an initial migration to set up the database schema based on the `BaseModel`.
- **Integration Points**: Database.
