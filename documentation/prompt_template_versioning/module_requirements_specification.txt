### Prompt Versioning Module Requirements Specification

#### 1. Module Description:
The prompt versioning module serves as a centralized prompt management module. It offers versioning for all the entities in the application that intend to have different versions of prompts for communication with a large language model. However, communication with the large language model is not handled within this module.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
- **None**: This module operates independently and does not rely on other modules within the application.

#### 3. Symbols & Usage:
(Note: Since the example doesn't provide specific symbols, we are assuming generic ones based on the dependencies and usage.)
- **[â‡Œ Independent]**: Denotes functionalities or interactions that are managed internally without relying on other modules.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:
- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any point, only one effective prompt is allowed for an entity.
   - Entity can designate any archived version as the current effective prompt, superseding the prior effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component that communicates with large language models should have a default prompt.
   - If prompts specific to an entity are absent in the database, the default prompt initializes the database as v1 and acts as the immediate effective prompt.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - Before any external system communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt for the respective entity from the database.
   - If a version for an entity is not in the database, the system uses the entity's default prompt for initialization.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Entities can introduce a new prompt version upon modifying the existing prompt.
   - A maximum of 4 prompt versions are maintained for each entity.
   - If a new version exceeds the 4-version cap, the oldest version is purged.

- **Database Management**:
   - Versions are depicted using simple incremented integers.
