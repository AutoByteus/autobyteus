### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
- Provide a brief overview of the primary architecture.
- Are there any design patterns that will be applied?

1.2. **New Components**:
- **ComponentA (New)**: Describe its purpose, role, and functionality.
- **ComponentB (New)**: Describe its purpose, role, and functionality.
... Continue as needed.
  
1.3. **Existing Components/Dependencies**:
- **ComponentX (Existing)**: Briefly describe its role and from which feature/module it originates.
- **ComponentY (Existing)**: Briefly describe its role and from which feature/module it originates.
... Continue as needed.

1.4. **Interactions**: 
- How do the new components interact with each other?
- How do the new components interact with the existing components?

1.5. **External Dependencies**: 
- List any third-party libraries, services, or tools that will be used.
- Are there any specific versions or configurations to be aware of?

#### 2. UML Diagram:
- Attach the UML diagram.
- **UML Legend**:
  - Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this feature.
  - Components marked with `(Existing)` are pre-existing and should be treated as dependencies.

### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
This feature implements the Observer Pattern, allowing numerous subscribers to be notified of certain events. An existing EventDatabase will store all the triggered events.

1.2. **New Components**:
- **Publisher (New)**: Broadcasts events to all subscribers and logs them to the EventDatabase.
- **Subscriber (New)**: Monitors and responds to particular events.

1.3. **Existing Components/Dependencies**:
- **EventDatabase (Existing)**: A database component that stores all triggered events.

1.4. **Interactions**: 
- Users liaise with the Publisher to initiate events. 
- The Publisher logs the event to the EventDatabase.
- Subsequently, the Publisher notifies all Subscribers of this occurrence.

1.5. **External Dependencies**: 
None.

#### 2. UML Diagram:

@startuml

class "Publisher (New)" {
    + trigger_event()
    + add_subscriber(subscriber: Subscriber)
    + log_event_to_database(event: Event)
}

class "Subscriber (New)" {
    + on_event_received()
}

class "EventDatabase (Existing)" {
    + save_event(event: Event)
}

"Publisher (New)" --> "Subscriber (New)": Event notification
"Publisher (New)" --> "EventDatabase (Existing)": Logs event
