### Module Architecture Design Specification:(Trial Phase)

#### 1. High-Level Design:
This module is designed around the Observer Pattern, promoting decoupling between event initiators (`Publisher`) and responders (`Subscriber`). This design ensures modularity, scalability, and efficient event handling.

#### 2. Component Summaries:

- **Publisher**: Serves as the event broadcaster. It is responsible for notifying subscribers of events and logging them. It maintains a list of registered subscribers and communicates with the `EventDatabase` for event logging.
  
- **Subscriber**: Acts as an event responder. It monitors and handles events broadcasted by the `Publisher`. Each subscriber maintains a history of received events.

- **EventDatabase**: A dedicated component for storing logged events. It captures and retains event data triggered by the `Publisher`.

#### 3. Interactions Overview:
Users or systems initiate events through the `Publisher`. Upon event initiation, the `Publisher` logs it into the `EventDatabase` and subsequently notifies all registered `Subscriber` entities of the event.

#### 4. UML Diagram:

@startuml

class "Publisher" {
    + Notifies subscribers of events
    + Logs events to EventDatabase
}

class "Subscriber" {
    + Monitors and handles events
}

class "EventDatabase" {
    + Stores logged events
}

"Publisher" --> "Subscriber": Event notification
"Publisher" --> "EventDatabase": Logs event
