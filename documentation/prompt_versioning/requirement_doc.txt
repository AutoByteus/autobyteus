### Prompt Versioning Mechanism for Optimal Communication with Large Language Models

#### 1. Feature Description:
This feature introduces a versioning mechanism for prompts, designed to cater to any entity or component that communicates with Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary goal is to harness the inherent variability in LLM responses based on prompt nuances, offering flexibility and a means for comparative analysis between different versions to determine the most effective prompt.

#### 2. Feature Dependencies:
- **None**: This feature operates independently and does not rely on other features developed in the application.

#### 3. Requirements:

3.1. **Functional Requirements**:

- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any given time, only one effective prompt is permitted for an entity.
   - Users (in this case, other backend systems or APIs) can select any archived version as the current effective prompt, which replaces the previously set effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component communicating with LLMs must have a distinct default prompt.
   - If the database lacks prompts specific to that entity, the default prompt initializes the database. This primary prompt is set as v1 and becomes the immediate effective prompt by default.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - At the start of any LLM communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt from the database for the concerned entity.
   - If a version for an entity is missing in the database, it initializes using the entity's inherent default prompt.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - A new prompt version for an entity can be created when the existing prompt undergoes alterations.
   - A maximum of 4 prompt versions is preserved for every entity in the database.
   - Introducing a new version that exceeds the 4-version limit results in the deletion of the oldest version.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
   - The system should allow for an API-based comparative analysis of different prompt versions, with potential to integrate a side-by-side comparison utility in future endeavors.

- **Database Management**:
   - Versions are symbolized using simple incremented numerals (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
   - The creation/modification timestamp for every version is archived.

3.2. **Technical Requirements**:
- **Database Interaction**:
   - The system should support efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing prompt versions.
   - Prompt versions are stored with unique identifiers, timestamps, and version numbers.
