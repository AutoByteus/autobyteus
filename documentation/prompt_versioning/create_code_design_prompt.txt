### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
This feature implements the Observer Pattern, allowing numerous subscribers to be notified of certain events. An existing EventDatabase will store all the triggered events.

1.2. **New Components**:
- **Publisher (New)**: Broadcasts events to all subscribers and logs them to the EventDatabase.
- **Subscriber (New)**: Monitors and responds to particular events.

1.3. **Existing Components/Dependencies**:
- **EventDatabase (Existing)**: A database component that stores all triggered events.

1.4. **Interactions**: 
- Users liaise with the Publisher to initiate events. 
- The Publisher logs the event to the EventDatabase.
- Subsequently, the Publisher notifies all Subscribers of this occurrence.

1.5. **External Dependencies**: 
None.

#### 2. UML Diagram:

@startuml

class "Publisher (New)" {
    + subscribers
    
    + trigger_event()
    + add_subscriber(subscriber: Subscriber)
    + log_event_to_database(event: Event)
}

class "Subscriber (New)" {
    + on_event_received()
}

class "EventDatabase (Existing)" {
    + save_event(event: Event)
}

"Publisher (New)" --> "Subscriber (New)": Event notification
"Publisher (New)" --> "EventDatabase (Existing)": Logs event

### Enhanced Automated Coding Workflow with Versioned Prompts for Comparative Analysis

#### 1. Story/Feature Description:

1.1. **Background**: 
The Automated Coding Workflow, designed to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating coding tasks, requires an upgrade. The inherent variability in LLM responses based on prompt nuances has led to the need for versioned prompts for each step. The aim is not just flexibility but also to enable comparative analysis between different versions to ascertain the most effective prompt.

1.2. **User Persona**: 
Software Developer or AI System:
  - Interacts with the Automated Coding Workflow to harness LLM capabilities.
  - Seeks to compare LLM responses for different prompt versions to determine the most effective prompt.
  - Wants a seamless interface to manage, select, and compare different prompt versions.

1.3. **User Journey**: 
A user interacts with a specific step in the Automated Coding Workflow. When they modify a prompt, they save it as a new version, preserving the original. Using a dropdown, they can easily switch between versions, running each one to obtain LLM responses. They subsequently compare the results to ascertain which prompt yields the most desirable output.

#### 2. Requirements:

2.1. **Functional Requirements**:

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Enable the addition of a new prompt version for a step when the current prompt is modified.
   - Store a maximum of 4 prompt versions for each step in the database.
   - Automatically set the newest version as the current version upon addition.
   - Provide an option for users to set any version as the current version.
   - Display all versions in a dropdown for user selection during interaction.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Facilitate switching between different prompt versions for running and obtaining LLM responses.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface to aid in comparing the results of different prompt versions.
   - Ensure that the process of comparison is intuitive and efficient.

- **Viewing Past Versions**:
   - Allow users to view the content of past versions of prompts for reference.
   - Ensure easy access and intuitive navigation to past versions.

- **Database Management**:
   - Represent versions using simple incrementing numbers (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
   - Implement an auto-delete mechanism to remove the oldest version when a new one exceeds the 4-version cap.

- **User Interface**:
   - Incorporate a dropdown mechanism in the user interface to facilitate prompt version selection.
   - Ensure clarity in version differentiation and facilitate the comparative analysis process.

### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
The feature orchestrates an automated coding workflow, modularly structured, where each individual step, derived from a `BaseStep`, represents a distinct phase in the workflow. One of the pivotal aspects of the design is that every step employs its own uniquely configured prompt, which is dispatched to a large language model (LLM) for processing. The workflow allows for serialization to JSON, and specific steps can be executed as needed. The design is enhanced with support for multi-layered steps and sub-steps.

1.2. **New Components**:
- **AutomatedCodingWorkflow (New)**: Manages the automated coding workflow. It is in charge of initializing steps, running specific steps, and serializing the workflow to JSON.
- **WORKFLOW_CONFIG (New)**: Offers configuration specifics for the entire workflow.
- **BaseStep (New)**: Serves as a foundational class for workflow steps. Every distinct step derives from this class and has its own prompt configuration for communication with the LLM.
- **WorkflowStatus (New)**: An enumeration potentially representing different states of the workflow.
- **StepsTemplateConfig (New)**: Configuration parameters for individual steps.
- **RequirementStep (New)**: Processes requirements using its own tailored prompt template.
- **ArchitectureDesignStep (New)**: Handles the architectural design phase with its unique prompt.
- **ImplementationStep (New)**: Oversees the coding implementation phase with its distinct prompt.
- **TestGenerationStep (New)**: Dedicated to generating tests for Python code, equipped with a detailed prompt.

1.3. **Existing Components/Dependencies**:
- **LLMIntegrationRegistry (Existing)**: From the `llm_integrations` package, it manages integrations pertinent to LLM.
- **WorkspaceSetting (Existing)**: Originating from the `workspaces` package, it holds workspace-specific settings.
- **PromptTemplate (Existing)**: From the `prompt` package, it's a template structure for constructing prompts.
- **PromptTemplateVariable (Existing)**: Also from the `prompt` package, it defines variables to be embedded in prompt templates.

1.4. **Interactions**: 
- The `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` initializes steps using the `WORKFLOW_CONFIG`.
- Every step, like `RequirementStep` or `ArchitectureDesignStep`, constructs a unique prompt using `PromptTemplate` and `PromptTemplateVariable`.
- The workflow status might be tracked and set using the `WorkflowStatus`.
- Steps may need to interact with the `LLMIntegrationRegistry` for integration management during execution.
- During initialization, the `WorkspaceSetting` is passed to the `AutomatedCodingWorkflow`.

1.5. **External Dependencies**: 
No third-party libraries, services, or tools have been identified from the provided code segments.
