### Repository Base Structure for AI Coding Agent

#### 1. Story/Feature Description:

1.1. **Background**: 
The requirement is for a repository base structure in Python that provides an interface to interact with a PostgreSQL database. This structure will serve as a foundational module for the AI coding agent application, upon which specific repositories can be built.

1.2. **User Persona**: 
AI Coding Agent â€“ A software agent responsible for executing operations on the database on behalf of the application.

1.3. **User Journey**: 
The AI coding agent, upon receiving a command or a task, interacts with the PostgreSQL database using the repository base structure. It can create, read, update, or delete records as necessary. In case of an error, the structure should either rollback the changes or log the error for further examination.

#### 2. Requirements:

2.1. **Functional Requirements**:

- **CRUD Operations**:
   - Create records in the database.
   - Read records from the database.
   - Update existing records in the database.
   - Delete records from the database.

- **Error Handling**:
   - Rollback any database changes when an error occurs during an operation.
   - Log errors for further investigation.

- **Integration**:
   - The structure should be modular and extensible, allowing other specific repositories to be built upon it, following the repository pattern.

**Reasoning**: 
The requirement document is structured to provide a clear and concise description of the feature. The background provides context, the user persona identifies the primary actor, and the user journey gives a brief about how the feature will be used. The functional requirements list out the specific functionalities expected from the feature, based on the user's inputs.
