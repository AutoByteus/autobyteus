After the design documentation is updated. please move on to creating subtasks based on code design documentation. These subtasks should follow the structure provided in the `[Template]` section.

### Approach 
1. **Think and Reason about Necessary Subtasks**:
    - Outline neccessary subtasks to achieve a complete feature. Remember, details can be minimal initially; focus on understanding the sequence and dependencies.
2. **Answer Preliminary Questions and give why**:
    - Any new libraries to install? 
    - Any new folders or files to create? If yes, Follow good python naming practices for creating folder names and file names. Use the 'Current Project    Folder Structure' section  for reference.
3. **Formalize the Creation of Subtasks based on previous analysis**:
    - Begin with Task 1 that should install relevant libraries, create all neccessary directories and files for all the other subtasks. For instance:
    ```
    Task 1: Preliminary Setup
    #task start#

    Objective: Install necessary libraries and set up the project directory structure.
    File Specification: requirements.txt, src/repositories, src/utils
    Functionality Details:
    Add SQLAlchemy and Alembic to the requirements.txt file.
    Create a repositories folder under src to house all repository-related classes.
    Create a utils folder under src for utility functions or classes.
    Create the files base_model.py in src/repositories and database_session_manager.py in src/utils for future tasks.
    Integration Points: None.
    #task end#
    ```
    - List all other subtasks in the order of their dependencies. 

### Current Project Folder Structure
    src
    tests
        unit_tests
        integration_tests
    requirements.txt

[Template]
#### Task [Number]: [Task Name]
#task start#
- **Objective**: [State the goal clearly.]
- **File Specification**: [Indicate the file path for the code.]
- **Functionality Details**: [Explain the code's behavior and purpose.]
- **Integration Points**: [Outline interactions with other code parts and dependencies.]
#task end#

[Example Task]
#### Task 8: Implement the `ShellHandler` Class
#task start#
- **Objective**: Create the `ShellHandler` class to manage shell operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/handlers/shell_handler.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should provide methods to interface with the `ShellOperation` class for shell tasks.
- **Integration Points**: It will be utilized by the `ShellOperation` class to execute shell commands.
#task end#

Follow the steps defined in the 'Approach' section. Think meticulously and reason comprehensively for each step in the approach.
